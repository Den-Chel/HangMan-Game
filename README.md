# Hangman Game

This repository contains the **Hangman Game** I created as part of my Python project during the second semester. The game demonstrates basic Python concepts like conditionals, loops, functions, and string manipulation, along with some advanced features like file handling or word randomization (if applicable).

## Features
- Classic Hangman gameplay.
- Randomly chosen words from a predefined list (or file).
- Displays the current state of the word with underscores for hidden letters.
- Tracks incorrect guesses and displays remaining attempts.
- Simple, interactive, and fun!

## How to Play
1. Run the `hangman.py` file in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python hangman.py
